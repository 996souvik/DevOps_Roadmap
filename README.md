# DevOps Learning Path

Welcome to the DevOps Learning Path repository! This guide is designed to help you start your journey into DevOps, providing a structured learning path and essential tools and technologies you'll need to master.

## What is DevOps?

In simple terms, DevOps is a process organizations use to merge their development and operations teams into a single unified team. This allows both teams to collaborate more effectively when developing and deploying applications. Itâ€™s like peanut butter and jelly â€“ they just belong together! ðŸ¥ªðŸ¥œ

DevOps is an umbrella phrase that refers to a set of technologies deployed to automate the operations of creating and distributing applications.

One of the primary advantages of DevOps is that automating these procedures saves time and reduces the likelihood of errors when compared to manual techniques. This automation results in a reduced Time to Market (TTM), making it perfect for rapidly growing businesses.
